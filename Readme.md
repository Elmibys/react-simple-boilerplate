# react-simple-boilerplate
A very simlpy boilerplate, that will help you jump straight into building react apps. The boilerplate only contains the most nessesary dependencies (according to me!).

2. Open in your preffered editor
3. Edit name, description, keywords and auther in package.json

6. Run "npm start"

This should launch the website in your default browser.
